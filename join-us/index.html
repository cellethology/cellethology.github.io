            <p>
                Our mission is audacious: to understand and improve life by simulating it. We are driven by interesting questions of living systems, not defined by any particular methods or experimental systems. While biological background is beneficial, we value diverse experiences, be it experimental, computational or theoretical. Please consider joining our mission, and hopefully we will have a lot of fun along the way. </p>
            
            <h2>Postdoctoral fellows and research assistants</h2>
            <p>We have several openings in the group for postdoctoral fellows and research assistants. Please <a href="mailto:jerry@westlake.edu.cn" class="text-link"><b>contact us</b></a> directly with a CV and a brief description of how your career plans align with our mission.</p>

            <h2>Graduate students</h2>
            <p>We are excited about mentoring the next generation of scientists. As a part of the Westlake Fellows program, we are able to advise graduate students through co-mentorship with another group. If you have already been accepted into a graduate program at Westlake University and are interested in pursuing your PhD with us, please <a href="mailto:jerry@westlake.edu.cn" class="text-link"><b>send us an email</b></a> with your CV and a brief summary of a project you are especially proud of.</p>
