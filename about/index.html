            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to understand and improve life by simulating it. It's a challenge so vast that the path forward isn't always clear, but that's part of the excitement.</p>

            <p>Biology is too complex and exciting to limit ourselves to any set of methods or experimental systems. We use any tools necessary to answer our questions, drawing from machine learning, cancer biology, tissue mechanics, and beyond. As we ask new questions, we expect new tools will become important.</p>
            
            <p>This is a long road, filled with unknowns and challenges. But for those who are excited by the prospect of reshaping our understanding of life itself, there's no more thrilling journey.</p>
